**ClusterOps** is an enterprise-grade Python library developed and maintained by the **Swarms Team** to help you manage and execute agents on specific **CPUs** and **GPUs** across clusters. This tool enables advanced CPU and GPU selection, dynamic task allocation, and resource monitoring, making it ideal for high-performance distributed computing environments.







---

## Features

- **CPU Execution**: Dynamically assign tasks to specific CPU cores.
- **GPU Execution**: Execute tasks on specific GPUs or dynamically select the best available GPU based on memory usage.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff for handling transient errors.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time CPU and GPU resource monitoring (e.g., free memory on GPUs).
- **Logging**: Advanced logging configuration with customizable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
- **Scalability**: Supports multi-GPU task execution with Ray for distributed computation.

## Installation


```bash
pip3 install -U clusterops
```

---

## Quick Start

The following example demonstrates how to use ClusterOps to run tasks on specific CPUs and GPUs.

```python
from clusterops import execute_with_cpu_cores, execute_on_gpu, retry_with_backoff

# Sample function to execute
def sample_task(n: int) -> int:
    return n * n

# Run the task on 4 CPU cores
result_cpu = execute_with_cpu_cores(4, sample_task, 10)
print(f"Result on CPU cores: {result_cpu}")

# Run the task on the best available GPU with retries
result_gpu = retry_with_backoff(execute_on_gpu, None, sample_task, 10)
print(f"Result on GPU: {result_gpu}")
```

---

## Usage

### Executing on Specific CPUs

You can execute a task on a specific number of CPU cores using the `execute_with_cpu_cores()` function. It automatically adjusts CPU affinity on systems where this feature is supported.

```python
from clusterops import execute_with_cpu_cores

def sample_task(n: int) -> int:
    return n * n

# Execute the task using 4 CPU cores
result = execute_with_cpu_cores(4, sample_task, 10)
print(f"Result on 4 CPU cores: {result}")
```

### Executing on Specific GPUs

ClusterOps supports running tasks on specific GPUs or dynamically selecting the best available GPU (based on free memory).

```python
from clusterops import execute_on_gpu

def sample_task(n: int) -> int:
    return n * n

# Execute the task on GPU with ID 1
result = execute_on_gpu(1, sample_task, 10)
print(f"Result on GPU 1: {result}")

# Execute the task on the best available GPU
result_best_gpu = execute_on_gpu(None, sample_task, 10)
print(f"Result on best available GPU: {result_best_gpu}")
```

### Retry Logic and Fault Tolerance

For production environments, ClusterOps includes retry logic with exponential backoff, which retries a task in case of failures.

```python
from clusterops import retry_with_backoff, execute_on_gpu

# Run task on the best GPU with retry logic
result = retry_with_backoff(execute_on_gpu, None, sample_task, 10)
print(f"Result with retry: {result}")
```

---

## Configuration

ClusterOps provides configuration through environment variables, making it adaptable for different environments (development, staging, production).

### Environment Variables

- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: Configures logging verbosity. Options: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`. Default is `INFO`.
- **`RETRY_COUNT`**: Number of times to retry a task in case of failure. Default is 3.
- **`RETRY_DELAY`**: Initial delay in seconds before retrying. Default is 1 second.

Set these variables in your environment:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export RETRY_COUNT=5
export RETRY_DELAY=2.0
```
