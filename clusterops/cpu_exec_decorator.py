    """
    Decorator that ensures the function runs on all available CPU cores,
    maximizing CPU and memory usage to execute the function as quickly as possible.

    This decorator sets the CPU affinity of the current process to all available CPU cores
    before executing the function. After the function completes, the original CPU affinity is restored.

    Args:
        func (Callable): The function to be executed.

    Returns:
        Callable: The wrapped function with CPU affinity settings applied.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the CPU affinity cannot be set or restored.
